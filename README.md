The current state-of-the-art monitor typically measures heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen content, temperature, and respiration rate.
However, only heart rate and sometimes blood pressure is sonified. Heart rate is represented audibly as rhythm and blood pressure as pitch. 
In addition to standardizing blood pressure as pitch, we suggest adding a third data point.
The new proposed monitor audio would sonify three vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen level.
For more information and a demonstration of the audio please check out the website linked above.
